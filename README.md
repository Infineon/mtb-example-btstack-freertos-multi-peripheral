## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade;</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example clones the "[Bluetooth&reg; LE multi-peripheral](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-btstack-freertos-multi-peripheral)" application with the desired name "multi-peripheral" configured for the *CY8CKIT-062-BLE* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-062-BLE --app-id mtb-example-btstack-freertos-multi-peripheral --user-app-name multi-peripheral --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Use your favorite serial terminal application and connect to the KitProg3 COM port. Configure the terminal application to access the serial port using the following settings.

   Baud rate: 115200 bps; Data: 8 bits; Parity: None; stop: 1 bit; Flow control: None; New line for receiving data: Line Feed(LF) or auto setting

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade;</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.

   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CKIT-062-BLE TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Observe the messages on the UART terminal. The device starts advertising with the name "LE Multi-Peripheral". Use a peer client app like AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app to scan and connect with the device. Use the KitProg3 COM port to view the Bluetooth&reg; stack and application trace messages in the terminal window:

   **Figure 1. Log messages on KitProg3 COM port**

   ![AppQR](./images/advertisement.png)


## Testing using the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect mobile app

1. Turn ON Bluetooth&reg; on your Android or iOS device.

2. Launch the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app.

3. Swipe down on the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app home screen to start scanning for Bluetooth&reg; LE peripherals; your device "LE Multi-Peripheral" appears on the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app home screen.

4. Pull down the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app home screen to start scanning for Bluetooth LE Peripherals; your device appears in the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app home screen as shown in Figure 2. Select your device to establish a Bluetooth LEconnection.

   **Figure 2. AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app home screen**

   ![AppQR](./images/mobile.png)

5. To connect another device, repeat steps 1 to 4. Up to four Central devices can be connected to the device.

6. On one or more of the connected devices, select the Device Information profile to get the device information, as shown in Figure 3.

   **Figure 3.Locating device information using AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app**

   ![AppQR](./images/device_info.png)

7. Select the Health Thermometer profile to get the temperature information as shown in Figure 4.

   **Figure 4.  Locating and using Health Thermometer service Using AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app**

   ![AppQR](./images/health.png)

8. Select the RGB LED profile to change the color of the RGB LED present in the kit as shown in Figure 5.

   **Figure 5. Locating and using RGB LED service using AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app**

   ![AppQR](./images/rgb_led.png)

9. Custom Service and Custom Notification Service can be accessed through the GattDB profile. The service can be identified using its Universally Unique Identifier (UUID).

10. Locate the Custom Service characteristic (UUID `E624B3AA-3397-4FC5-A7B0-4ACB2776687D`). Using this service, a GAP Central device can read or write 128-bit data.

11. Locate the Custom Notification Service characteristic (UUID `3D62A222-42FB-43B0-B0A0-C9D9D55AC8D9`). This service is used to notify the GAP Central device that last modified any of the characteristics. The data payload contains three bytes of information.

- XXXXYY -> XXXX device ID. (0000 -> Default, 8000 to 8003),
         -> YY characteristics (00 -> Default, 01 -> RGB LED, 02 -> Custom Service)


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging PSoC™ 6 MCU)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/t5/Knowledge-Base-Articles/PSoC-6-MCU-Code-in-main-executes-before-the-debugger-halts-at-the-first-line-of/ta-p/253856) to learn about this and for the workaround.

**Note:** Debugging is of limited value when there is an active Bluetooth&reg; LE connection because as soon as the Bluetooth&reg; LE device stops responding, the connection will get dropped.


## Design and implementation

This code example implements Bluetooth&reg; LE multi-peripheral functionality that consists of the following:
- Device Information service
- Health Thermometer service
- Custom service for RGB LED with color and intensity control
- 128-bit long characteristic read write custom service
- A custom notification service

In this application, the state of the RGB LED is controlled using PWM blocks. The PWM HAL resource is configured for controlling the brightness of the LED.

The device simulates thermistor readings and sends it over to the Health Thermometer service. CY8CKIT-028-EPD E-INK Display Shield is used and connect to the CY8CKIT-062-BLE and CYBLE-416045-EVAL kits. CY8CKIT-028-EPD E-INK Display Shield contains a thermistor sensor which is used for reading the temperature data. CYW920829M2EVK-02 kit has inbuilt thermistor sensor which is connected to the Analog Pin A0. For pin connections, see Table 1.

The custom service is used to transfer 128-bit data. The custom notification is used to send a notification to all connected devices about any changes. It sends 3-byte data; the first two bytes to notify the device that modified the data and the third byte to notify the characteristic data that has been modified.

The application uses a UART resource from the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to print debug messages on a UART terminal emulator. The UART resource initialization and retargeting of standard I/O to the UART port are done using the retarget-io library.

## Resources and settings

This section explains the ModusToolbox&trade; resources and their configurations as used in this code example. Note that all the configurations explained in this section have already been implemented in the code example.

- **Device Configurator:** ModusToolbox&trade; stores the configuration settings of the application in the *design.modus* file. This file is used by Device Configurator, which generates the configuration firmware. This firmware is stored in the application’s *GeneratedSource* folder.

   By default, all applications in a workspace share the same *design.modus* file - i.e., they share the same pin configuration. Each BSP has a default *design.modus* file in the *mtb_shared\TARGET_\<bsp name\>\<version\>\COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS* directory. It is not recommended to modify the configuration of a standard BSP directly.

   To modify the configuration for a single application or to create a custom BSP, see the [ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide). This example uses the default configuration. See the [Device Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxDeviceConfig).

- **Bluetooth&reg; Configurator:** The Bluetooth&reg; Peripheral has an additional configurator called “Bluetooth&reg; Configurator” that is used to generate the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT database and various Bluetooth&reg; settings for the application. These settings are stored in the file named *design.cybt*.

   Note that unlike Device Configurator, Bluetooth&reg; Configurator settings and files are local to each application. The services and characteristics added are explained in the [Design and implementation](#design-and-implementation) section. See the [Bluetooth&reg; Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxBLEConfig).

**Note:** For PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE-based BSP (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) with support for AIROC&trade; BTSTACK, if you want to use Bluetooth&reg; Configurator, select the **AIROC&trade; BTSTACK with Bluetooth&reg; LE only (CYW20829, PSoC&trade; 6 with CYW43xxx Connectivity device)** option from the dropdown to select the device. Do not use the **PSoC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; LE Legacy Stack (PSoC&trade; 6-BLE)** option because it is not compatible with AIROC&trade; BTSTACK.

**Table 1. Application resources**

| Resource  |  Alias/object     |    Purpose     |
| :------- | :------------    | :------------ |
| UART (HAL)|cy_retarget_io_uart_obj| UART HAL object used by Retarget-IO for Debug UART port|
| GPIO (HAL)    | CYBSP_LED_RGB_RED, CYBSP_LED_RGB_BLUE, CYBSP_LED_RGB_BLUE   | These GPIOs are configured as firmware-controlled digital output pins that control LEDs |
